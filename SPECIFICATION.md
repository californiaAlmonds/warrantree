> For development progress tracking, see [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)

## Project Overview
WarranTree is a full-stack application that helps users track warranties, expiry dates, and important documents. The app provides automated reminders, family sharing capabilities, and claim assistance to ensure users never miss important deadlines.

## Problem Statement
- People lose track of warranties, bills, and expiry dates (IDs, insurance, AMCs)
- Claims fail due to missing documentation or expired deadlines
- No centralized system to manage family/household items
- Manual tracking is unreliable and time-consuming

## Solution
A digital vault that automatically tracks purchase dates, warranty periods, and expiry dates with smart reminders and family sharing capabilities.

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Families and individuals managing household warranties and documents
- **Secondary**: Small business owners tracking equipment warranties
- **Tertiary**: Property managers handling multiple units/appliances

## Core Use Cases

### 1. Item Management
- Add new items (appliances, electronics, insurance policies, etc.)
- Upload and attach receipts, warranty cards, manuals
- Automatically calculate expiry dates
- Categorize items by type, room, or priority
- Edit/update item details and extend warranties

### 2. Reminder System
- Email notifications before expiry (30, 7, 1 day)
- Customizable reminder schedules per item
- Smart reminders based on item category (e.g., earlier for insurance)
- Mark items as renewed, expired, or claimed

### 3. Family Sharing
- Create family vaults with multiple members
- Role-based permissions (owner, editor, viewer)
- Share specific items or entire categories
- Activity logs for transparency

### 4. Document Management
- Secure file upload and storage
- Image optimization and compression
- Receipt/document viewer with zoom
- Multiple attachments per item
- Document search within vault

### 5. Claim Assistance
- Generate claim kits with all relevant documents
- Warranty status checker
- Seller/manufacturer contact information
- Step-by-step claim guidance

vaults (id, owner_user_id, name, description, created_at)
vault_members (vault_id, user_id, role, joined_at)

-- Item management
categories (id, name, icon, reminder_days_default)
items (id, vault_id, title, category_id, brand, model, serial_number, 
       purchase_date, price, warranty_months, expiry_date, notes, 
       status, created_at, updated_at)

-- File management
attachments (id, item_id, file_url, file_name, file_size, file_type, 
            uploaded_at, uploaded_by_user_id)

-- Reminder system

### Security Implementation
- JWT tokens with 15min access + 7day refresh
- Password hashing with BCrypt
- CORS configuration for frontend domain
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- File upload validation (size, type, virus scan)
- SQL injection protection via JPA
- XSS protection with proper headers

### Deployment Architecture

- **Domain**: Custom domain optional

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Image compression and resizing via Cloudinary
- Pagination for large item lists
- Lazy loading for attachments
- Client-side caching with React Query
- CDN for static assets

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Error tracking with Sentry (optional)
- Application metrics via provider dashboards
- User analytics for feature usage
- Performance monitoring with Web Vitals
