## üìù Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Monorepo vs Separate Repos**: Separate repos for frontend/backend for easier deployment
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Context for global UI state
- **File Upload Strategy**: Direct upload to Cloudinary with signed URLs
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens for better UX

### Coding Standards
- **Backend**: Follow Spring Boot conventions, use DTOs for API responses
- **Frontend**: Use functional components with hooks, implement error boundaries
- **Database**: Use migrations for schema changes, proper indexing for performance
- **API**: RESTful design with proper HTTP status codes

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Critical business logic and utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations  
- **E2E Tests**: Key user flows (signup, add item, receive reminder)
- **Manual Testing**: Cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness
